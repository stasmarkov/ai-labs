# Benchmarks

## Versions

Rows come from `bench/versions.sh` (needs `/debug/runtime` enabled with `DEBUG_ROUTES=true`), one per server.

- **nginx-fpm and apache-fpm** are pinned: PHP 8.4 in `.ddev/config.yaml`, and the web server and PHP patch versions come from the DDEV web image, so the DDEV version pins them.
- **openlitespeed is pinned by the image tag** `litespeedtech/openlitespeed:1.9.4-lsphp84`, which fixes OpenLiteSpeed and the lsphp 8.4 build. The one exception is the `lsphp84-pgsql` package, installed at build time without a version, so a rebuild that misses the Docker cache can pull a newer PHP patch release. The row is a point-in-time record: re-run `bench/versions.sh` after any rebuild.
- **frankenphp is not pinned.** The add-on is pinned at v1.3.0, but it installs the `frankenphp` and `php-zts-*` packages without versions from pkg.henderkes.com. Any web-image rebuild that misses the Docker cache (a DDEV upgrade, `ddev utility rebuild`, another machine) can install newer FrankenPHP, Caddy and PHP patch releases. The frankenphp row is a point-in-time record: re-run `bench/versions.sh` after any rebuild and before every benchmark, and update the row.

| Active server | Web server version | DDEV version | PHP | SAPI | OPcache | Date |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------|-----|------|---------|------|
| nginx-fpm | 1.26.3 | 1.25.4 | 8.4.24 | fpm-fcgi | true | 2026-10-29 |
| apache-fpm | 2.4.68 | 1.25.4 | 8.4.24 | fpm-fcgi | true | 2026-10-29 |
| frankenphp | 1.13.4 | 1.25.4 | 8.4.27 | frankenphp | true | 2026-10-29 |
| openlitespeed | 1.9.4 | 1.25.4 | 8.4.27 | litespeed | true | 2026-10-30 |

FrankenPHP row: ddev/ddev-frankenphp v1.3.0, Caddy v2.11.7

The FrankenPHP row runs classic mode (no worker) on thread-safe PHP, so its PHP patch version differs from the FPM rows.

## Response parity

`bench/parity/nginx-fpm.txt`, `bench/parity/apache-fpm.txt`, `bench/parity/frankenphp.txt` and `bench/parity/openlitespeed.txt` hold the status, media type and body SHA-256 of a fixed request set of 7 requests, captured on 2026-10-29 (openlitespeed on 2026-10-30) from the same seeded database on stock DDEV server configs (FrankenPHP and OpenLiteSpeed from their stashes). `bench/parity.sh compare nginx-fpm apache-fpm`, `bench/parity.sh compare nginx-fpm frankenphp` and `bench/parity.sh compare apache-fpm frankenphp` all report `identical`, and so does `bench/parity.sh compare nginx-fpm openlitespeed`.

OpenLiteSpeed answers on its own port, `https://interview.ddev.site:8091`, while the `web` container stays idle on nginx-fpm. `capture` rewrites that base URL to the plain site URL before hashing, so the snapshot compares directly with the others.

### PHP settings per server (what differs and why)

| Setting | DDEV web (PHP-FPM) | FrankenPHP | lsphp default | lsphp as configured |
|---------|--------------------|------------|---------------|---------------------|
| `opcache.memory_consumption` | 500 | from FPM `php.ini` | 128 | 500 |
| `opcache.max_accelerated_files` | 1000000 | from FPM `php.ini` | 10000 | 1000000 |
| `opcache.interned_strings_buffer` | 16 | from FPM `php.ini` | 8 | 16 |
| `opcache.revalidate_freq` | 2 | from FPM `php.ini` | 2 | 2 |
| `date.timezone` | host timezone | host timezone | unset | UTC |

- **Why OPcache matters for fairness.** OPcache keeps compiled PHP in shared memory. With 10 000 slots and about 10 600 PHP files in this app, the lsphp default would fill up and keep evicting or skipping files, which makes OpenLiteSpeed look slower for a reason that has nothing to do with the server. `.ddev/servers/openlitespeed/conf/zz-opcache.ini` sets the same values as the FPM pool. `revalidate_freq=2` (check file timestamps at most every 2 s) is already the same everywhere.
- **Timezone.** PHP's `date.timezone` only affects PHP's own messages; every date in a response comes from Laravel's `config('app.timezone')` (UTC). lsphp uses UTC instead of copying the host timezone.
- **`X-Forwarded-Proto`.** The OLS vhost sets `HTTPS=on` when the request carries `X-Forwarded-Proto: https`, which is how the DDEV router tells the backend that the client used TLS. It trusts the header from any sender, exactly like DDEV's own nginx config does; that is fine on a dev network, but in production only the proxy's address should be trusted (Laravel `trustProxies`).
- **`.htaccess`.** OpenLiteSpeed applies only the rewrite rules from `public/.htaccess`, reads them at start-up, and needs `ddev restart` after a change. With the routing left entirely to `.htaccess`, the trailing-slash redirect behaves as on Apache (`/listings/` → 301).

Known differences that the comparison deliberately ignores:

- **Content-Type charset.** nginx serves JSON as `application/json; charset=utf-8`; Apache serves `application/json`. The app sends the same body; the parameter is added by nginx's `charset_types`. Parity compares the media type only.
- **`/up` render time.** Laravel's health page prints `rendered in <n>ms`, which changes on every request; it is masked before hashing, for `/up` only.
- **Headers** such as `Server` and `Date` differ by design and are not compared.
